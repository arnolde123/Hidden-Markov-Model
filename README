To run the file, call 

python HMM.py HMM.txt sequence
R
The sequence should be a list of observations in order, separated by commas.
HMM.txt can also be replaced with any other txt file, as long as they are in the same format.

The file contains 3 methods, one to load the file, one to print the given probabilities,
and one to calculate the distribution and alpha value at each step given the input sequence.
This is all printed with the last method.
